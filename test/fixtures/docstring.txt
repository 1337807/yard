= Introduction 

This is a sample docstring for testing purposes

  It includes most of the RDoc syntax, though

@param normal a normal parameter with no type
  
  * It shouldn't matter
  * What the RDoc data is
  
Finally:: It also contains meta data tags:

@raise IOError an ioerror if things go wrong
@author Loren Segal
@deprecated
@param [String] obj the first object in the list
@param [String, Array<String>] obj2
@return [Object] it really will
                 return anything 
                 it wants.
